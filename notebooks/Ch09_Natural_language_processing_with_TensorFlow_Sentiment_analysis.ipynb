The data source is a real-world Amazon review dataset (Video Games category), which is a good example of what practical text data looks like:\n","- large scale (hundreds of thousands of reviews),\n","- noisy and inconsistent writing,\n","- imbalanced ratings,\n","- and extra metadata that can be used for filtering (for example, `verified` purchases).\n","\n","The objective is **sentiment analysis**: given a review text, predict whether the sentiment is positive or negative.\n","\n","I follow the chapter’s structure:\n","1) download + inspect the dataset,\n","2) filter and label it in a way that matches the problem definition,\n","3) create train/validation/test splits carefully (balanced validation/test sets),\n","4) explore vocabulary size and sequence length (to set model hyperparameters),\n","5) build an end-to-end TensorFlow pipeline (raw text → vectorization → model),\n","6) train and evaluate a sentiment classifier (LSTM-based),\n","7) inspect model behavior by looking at predictions and mistakes.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"94d1bb17","metadata":{"id":"94d1bb17"},"source":["## 1) Summary\n","\n","### 1.1 What makes text different from images\n","Text is not naturally represented as a fixed-size tensor. A review is a variable-length sequence of words, and different reviews can have completely different lengths and vocabulary. This means the “data preparation” stage in NLP is not optional; it is a core part of the modeling pipeline.\n","\n","In this chapter, I treat sentiment analysis as a classification task. The model receives a review (sequence of tokens) and predicts one of two classes:\n","- **positive** sentiment\n","- **negative** sentiment\n","\n","### 1.2 Dataset and labeling choice\n","The dataset used is the Amazon review dataset (Video Games, small category file). Each record is a JSON dictionary with fields such as:\n","- `reviewText` (main text),\n","- `overall` (star rating: 1 to 5),\n","- `verified` (whether the reviewer is a verified buyer).\n","\n","To define sentiment labels, the chapter makes a practical modeling decision:\n","- **4 or 5 stars → positive (label = 1)**\n","- **1, 2, or 3 stars → negative (label = 0)**\n","\n","This reduces complexity compared with five-class prediction, and it turns the problem into a binary classification task that is easier to optimize and evaluate.\n","\n","### 1.3 Why the split strategy matters\n","A naive random split would produce validation/test sets that inherit the same class imbalance as the full dataset. With strong imbalance, standard accuracy can be misleading (a model can do “well” by mostly predicting the majority class).\n","\n","The chapter’s approach is more careful:\n","- build **balanced validation and test sets** (equal positives and negatives),\n","- assign all remaining data points to the training set.\n","\n","This makes validation/test metrics easier to interpret because they are not dominated by the majority class.\n","\n","### 1.4 What “getting text ready” really means\n","Before model training, I need to decide:\n","- how to tokenize text (word-level tokens),\n","- how large the vocabulary should be (`VOCAB_SIZE`),\n","- how long sequences should be (`SEQ_LEN`),\n","- and how to handle out-of-vocabulary tokens.\n","\n","Instead of hardcoding these, I measure them from the training corpus:\n","- compute word frequency distribution (to understand how quickly coverage grows),\n","- compute review length distribution (to pick a sequence length that covers most examples).\n","\n","These are not just “EDA details”; they directly impact model quality and training stability.\n","\n","### 1.5 End-to-end modeling pipeline in TensorFlow\n","The pipeline I build has a clean boundary:\n","- **input**: raw text strings,\n","- **output**: sentiment probability.\n","\n","In between, TensorFlow handles preprocessing using `TextVectorization`, which keeps the workflow reproducible:\n","- tokenization and vocabulary mapping are inside the graph,\n","- the model can be saved and reloaded without needing an external preprocessing script.\n","\n","The core model for this chapter is LSTM-based:\n","- the embedding layer converts token IDs to dense vectors,\n","- the LSTM summarizes the sequence into a fixed-size representation,\n","- a classifier head predicts sentiment.\n","\n","### 1.6 Practical evaluation and inspection\n","I do not rely only on “a single accuracy number”. I also check:\n","- confusion matrix,\n","- precision/recall (especially useful if the real-world label distribution is imbalanced),\n","- examples with the highest positive/negative scores,\n","- and misclassified examples, to understand what the model is getting wrong.\n","\n","This part is important because text models can learn shortcuts (keywords, negations, sarcasm patterns) and it is easy to trust a metric without realizing the model behavior is brittle.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4cd3347a","metadata":{"id":"4cd3347a"},"source":["## 2) Setup\n","\n","Imports and reproducibility settings."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"id":"aca5cd49","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"aca5cd49","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767986799427,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":6723,"user":{"displayName":"Anom","userId":"07557807243162324433"}},"outputId":"f1250feb-3f61-4b0c-9ee3-1955cf60ea30"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Trying: https://mcauleylab.ucsd.edu/public_datasets/data/amazon_v2/categoryFilesSmall/Video_Games_5.json.gz\n","Downloaded OK (146.84 MB): data/Video_Games_5.json.gz\n","Extracting: data/Video_Games_5.json.gz\n","Extracted: data/Video_Games_5.json\n"]}],"source":["import os\n","import gzip\n","import shutil\n","import socket\n","import subprocess\n","import urllib.request\n","from pathlib import Path\n","\n","DATA_DIR = Path(\"data\")\n","DATA_DIR.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n","\n","gz_path = DATA_DIR / \"Video_Games_5.json.gz\"\n","json_path = DATA_DIR / \"Video_Games_5.json\"\n","\n","# Official + fallbacks (same file name)\n","URLS = [\n","    \"https://mcauleylab.ucsd.edu/public_datasets/data/amazon_v2/categoryFilesSmall/Video_Games_5.json.gz\",\n","    \"https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon_v2/categoryFilesSmall/Video_Games_5.json.gz\",\n","    \"http://deepyeti.ucsd.edu/jianmo/amazon/categoryFilesSmall/Video_Games_5.json.gz\",\n","]\n","\n","def is_gzip_file(path: Path) -> bool:\n","    if not path.exists():\n","        return False\n","    try:\n","        with open(path, \"rb\") as f:\n","            return f.read(2) == b\"\\x1f\\x8b\"  # gzip magic bytes\n","    except Exception:\n","        return False\n","\n","def download_with_wget(url: str, out_path: Path) -> bool:\n","    cmd = [\n","        \"wget\",\n","        \"--continue\",\n","        \"--timeout=60\",\n","        \"--tries=10\",\n","        \"--user-agent=Mozilla/5.0\",\n","        \"-O\",\n","        str(out_path),\n","        url,\n","    ]\n","    result = subprocess.run(cmd, check=False, capture_output=True, text=True)\n","    if result.returncode != 0:\n","        print(\"wget failed:\", result.stderr.strip()[:300])\n","        return False\n","    return True\n","\n","def download_with_urllib(url: str, out_path: Path) -> bool:\n","    try:\n","        socket.setdefaulttimeout(60)\n","        opener = urllib.request.build_opener()\n","        opener.addheaders = [(\"User-agent\", \"Mozilla/5.0\")]\n","        urllib.request.install_opener(opener)\n","        urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, out_path)\n","        return True\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        print(\"urllib failed:\", e)\n","        return False\n","\n","# --- Download ---\n","if not gz_path.exists() or not is_gzip_file(gz_path):\n","    if gz_path.exists():\n","        print(\"Found invalid/corrupted file.
